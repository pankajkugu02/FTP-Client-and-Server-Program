# FTP-Client-and-Server-Program
Till now we have written code for client and server .Client will send "Hello Server" then Server will send "Hello Client".

Then we updated our code,and now client will send a message to server to send the directory ,the server will send the directory to the client and will ask client which file do you want,then client will reply and then server will send that file.
